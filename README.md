# Rapid

Visual code editor primarily built for game engines.

## Motivation

There were two major reasons to develop this software. One being because I was looking into visual programming, and how it could improve programming in general.
The second being that I was developing a game/ graphics engine, and it would be nice to have a visual programming feature to it, so that we can easily edit and
test out pipelines and shaders. This got me thinking, why not expand it to support C++, and then let game engines use this as a scripting language. But with the
added benefit of it being coded in C++. Most modern game engines are based on C++, and use different scripting languages to code the game logic. For Unreal Engine
we have C++ and blueprints. For Unity we have C# scripts. Godot engine has their own scripting language. Wouldn't it be easier to have a scripting-like language
which you can easily develop with the native language which the engine is built up upon?

This makes engine design and development even more simpler, as everything can be done using visual scripting, thus improving development times, lowering the bar
for people who are new to game dev, having the performance you are looking for, reducing the engine complexity and much more.
